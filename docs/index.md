# Overview

ABINIT is probably the first electronic-structure package to have been released under an open-source license, 
more than twenty years ago. It implements density functional theory (DFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT),
many-body perturbation theory (GW approximation and Bethe-Salpether equation), and more specific or advanced
formalisms, like dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the "temperature-dependent effective potential" (TDEP)
approach for anharmonic effects. Relying on planewaves for the representation of wavefunctions, density and other
space-dependent quantities, with pseudopotentials or projector-augmented waves (PAW), it is well suited for the study
of periodic materials, although nanostructures and molecules can be treated with the supercell technique.
